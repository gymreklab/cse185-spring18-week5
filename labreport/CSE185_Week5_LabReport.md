## Abstract (0.5 pt)

## Introduction (2 pts)

2-3 paragraphs max
* What question(s) sare we trying to answer?
* Why is this question important?

## Methods (2 pts total)

Break your methods section into subheadings for each of the following topics, with 1 paragraph for each:

### Dataset description (0.5 pts)
* Describe our GWAS cohort. How many samples were collected? How many have blue vs. brown eyes? How many SNPs were genotyped?
* Describe the cohort used for eye color prediction. How many samples were included? How many SNPs did we look at?

### GWAS (1 pt)
* Describe how you used plink (and which version) to perform the GWAS. How did you control for population structure?
* How did you "clump" variants into independent signals? Describe the parameters you used for plink.

### Eye color prediction (0.5 pt)

## Results (2 pts total)

Break your methods section into subheadings for each of the following topics.
You may have 2-3 paragraphs max for each. Make sure each figure is clearly referenced in the text.

### GWAS (1 pt)
* How many variants pass genome-wide significance in the GWAS with and without controlling for population structure? After clumping variants, how many independent signals remain?
* Include Manhattan plots and QQ plots for each GWAS carried out.
* Include a table of genome-wide significant results after clumping.

### Eye color prediction (1 pt)
* Include and reference a supplementary table of results with eye color predictions for each sample
* Include at least one genome browser screenshot of one of the six eye color SNPs and your interpretation of how that SNP might be affecting eye color.

### Topic 1 (? pt)

## Discussion (2 pts)
* Did you identify all the known SNPs contributing to eye color? If not, why do you think you might have missed them?
* Hypothesize how the 6 SNPs used in Part II might be affecting eye color. 

## Citations (1 pt)
Include at least one citation
